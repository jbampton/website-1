- Understand risk as a _spectrum_, rather than an item on a register.
- Understand the appropriate domain for Agile and Planned methodologies.
- Move beyond "Agile"  and "Planned" approaches, to a right-tool-for-the-job approach.

## Main Areas

- [Understanding Complexity](../complexity/Start.md)

- [Placing Bets](../bets/Purpose-Development-Team.md)
