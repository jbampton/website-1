# Stop Estimating, Start Navigating

### Competing Goals

![Goals](/images/generated/estimating/planner/goals.png)

A confounding problem with goals is that _everyone has their own_.  While the business might be there to _make money_, everyone else on the project will have their own _personal_ goals (as you can see on the diagram above).   

Let's look at the "Fix the Continuous Integration Pipeline" task.  It might turn out that we have competing goals here:  the Development Team might want to spend time on this task, as the existing, poor CI tooling is damaging productivity and causing acrimony in the team.  No one wants to work in an unproductive environment.

That said, the product owners might worry about a different risk:  while diverting part of the development effort to fixing CI might help productivity _in the long term_, it might add pressure to the schedule _in the short term_, and delay other important tasks from getting done, as shown in the above diagram.    





The third question you need to always be asking is:  _what is our goal?_

Considered individually, the tasks on our backlog clearly are operations which change the risks we are facing, but unless we understand the _goal_ or _goals_ of the product, we're not really in a position to make judgements about whether some set of risks is better or worse.

If we are a startup with some investors, they might have set us the goal themselves.  Perhaps the future funding of the business is predicated on our ability to generate a certain number of subscribers?  Then the business goal might look like that in the diagram above.

##### The rounded-corner containers with bold titles show _who a risk affects_.  

As you can see in this diagram _goals_ look very similar to _risks_.  This is by design:  a _goal_ is really an "upside risk":  it's a possible future, but one we'd like to _move towards_ instead of _away from_.
