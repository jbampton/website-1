# Stop Estimating, Start Navigating

### Competing Goals

![Goals](/images/generated/estimating/planner/goals.png)

A confounding problem with goals is that _everyone has their own_.  While the business might be there to _make money_, everyone else on the project will have their own _personal_ goals (as you can see on the diagram above).   

Let's look at the "Fix the Continuous Integration Pipeline" task.  It might turn out that we have competing goals here:  the Development Team might want to spend time on this task, as the existing, poor CI tooling is damaging productivity and causing acrimony in the team.  No one wants to work in an unproductive environment.

That said, the product owners might worry about a different risk:  while diverting part of the development effort to fixing CI might help productivity _in the long term_, it might add pressure to the schedule _in the short term_, and delay other important tasks from getting done, as shown in the above diagram.
