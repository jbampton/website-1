# Glossary of Risk Types

| Risk             | Definition                                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[Boundary](Boundary-Risk.md)|Risks due to the commitments we make around dependencies, and the limitations they place on our ability to change.|
|[Agency](Agency-Risk.md)|Risks due to the fact that things you depend on have agency, and they have their own goals to pursue.|
|[Channel](Communication-Risk.md#channel-risk)|Risks due to the inadequacy of the physical channel used to communicate our messages. e.g. noise, loss, interception, corruption.|
|[Communication](Communication-Risk.md)|Risks due to the difficulty of communicating with other entities, be they people, software, processes etc.|
|[Codebase](Complexity-Risk.md#codebase-risk)|The specific risks to a project of having a large, complex codebase to manage.|
|[Complexity](Complexity-Risk.md)|Risks caused by the weight of complexity in the systems we create, and their resistance to change and comprehension.|
|[Conceptual-integrity](Feature-Risk.md#conceptual-integrity-risk)|Risk that the software you provide is too complex, or doesn't match the expectations of your clients' internal models.|
|[Coordination](Coordination-Risk.md)|Risks that a group of agents cannot work together in a mutually beneficial way, and their behaviour devolves into competition.|
|[Dead-End](Complexity-Risk.md#dead-end-risk)|The risk that a particular approach to a change will fail.  Caused by the fact that at some level, our internal models are not a complete reflection of reality.|
|[Deadline](Deadline-Risk.md)|Where the use of a dependency has some kind of deadline, which can be missed.|
|[Dependency](Dependency-Risk.md)|Risks faced by depending on something else.  e.g. an event, process, person, piece of software or an organisation.   |
|[Feature-Access](Feature-Risk.md#feature-access-risk)|Risks due to some clients not having access to some or all of the features in your product.|
|[Feature-Drift](Feature-Risk.md#feature-drift-risk)|Risk that the features required by clients will change and evolve over time.   |
|[Feature](Feature-Risk.md)|Risks you face when providing features for your clients.|
|[Feature-Fit](Feature-Risk.md#feature-fit-risk)|Risk that the needs of the client don't coincide with services provided by the supplier.|
|[Funding](Scarcity-Risk.md#funding-risk)|A particular scarcity risk, due to lack of funding.|
|[Implementation](Feature-Risk.md#implementation-risk)|Risk that the functionality you are providing doesn't match the features the client is expecting, due to poor or partial implementation.|
|[Internal-Model](Communication-Risk.md#internal-model-risk)|Risks arising from insufficient or erroneous internal models of reality.|
|[Invisibility](Communication-Risk.md#invisibility-risk)|Risks caused by the choice of abstractions we use in communication.|
|[Learning-Curve](Communication-Risk.md#learning-curve-risk)|Risks due to the difficulty faced in updating an internal model.|
|[Map-And-Territory](Map-And-Territory-Risk.md)|Risks due to the differences between reality and the internal model of reality, and the assumption that they are equivalent. |
|[Market](Feature-Risk.md#market-risk)|Risk that the value your clients place on the features you supply will change, over time.|
|[Message](Communication-Risk.md#message-risk)|Risks caused by the difficulty of composing and interpreting messages in the communication process.|
|[Operational](Operational-Risk.md)|Risks of losses or reputational damage caused by failing processes or real-world events.|
|[Opportunity](Scarcity-Risk.md#opportunity-risk)|Risk that a particular set of market conditions.|
|[Process](Process-Risk.md)|Risks due to the fact that when dealing with a dependency, we have to follow a particular protocol of communication, which may not work out the way we want.|
|[Protocol](Communication-Risk.md#protocol-risk)|Risks due to the failure of encoding or decoding messages between two parties in communication.  |
|[Red-Queen](Scarcity-Risk.md#red-queen-risk)|The general risk that the competitive environment we operate within changes over time.|
|[Regression](Feature-Risk.md#regression-risk)|Risk that the functionality you provide changes for the worse, over time.|
|[Reliability](Dependency-Risk.md#reliability-risk)|Risks of not getting benefit from a dependency due to it's reliability.|
|[Scarcity](Scarcity-Risk.md)|Risk of not being able to access a dependency in a timely fashion due to it's scarcity.|
|[Schedule](Scarcity-Risk.md#schedule-risk)|The aspect of dependency risk related to time.|
|[Security](Agency-Risk.md#security)|Agency Risks due to actors from outside the system.|
|[Software Dependency](Software-Dependency-Risk.md)|Dependency Risk due to software dependencies.|
|[Staff](Scarcity-Risk.md#staff-risk)|The aspect of dependency risks related to employing people.|
|[Trust-And-Belief](Communication-Risk.md#trust--belief-risk)|Risk that a party we are communicating with can't be trusted, as it has agency or is unreliable in some other way.  |
