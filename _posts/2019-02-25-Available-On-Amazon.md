Probably, some of you have ordered the Kindle edition (this should already have been sent to your devices). Paperback is now available to buy (takes a day or so to arrive with Prime).  Looks nice I think:

Many thanks to all the contributors that helped out with this.  I believe I have credited everyone in the book.

I have lots of further ideas on how to take this project forward... will be posting some of those in the coming weeks, but let me know if you have any suggestions.
