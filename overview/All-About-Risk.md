# It's All About Risk

One of the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto), Kent Beck states in his book:

> "It's all about risk" - [Kent Beck, _Extreme Programming Explained_](http://amzn.eu/d/gUQjnbF)

This is a promising start.  From there, he introduces his methodology, [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), and explains how you can adopt it in your team, the features to observe and the characteristics of success and failure.  However, while _Risk_ has clearly driven the conception of Extreme Programming, there is no clear model of software risk underpinning the work.

Risk-First introduces a model of software risk.  This means that we can properly analyse Extreme Programming (and Scrum, Waterfall, Lean and all the others) and _understand_ what drives them.  Since they are designed to deliver successful software projects, they must be about managing risks, and we will uncover _exactly which risks_ and _how they do it_.
