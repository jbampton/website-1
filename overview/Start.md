The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?

The Risk-First perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _software development risks_.  Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives everything we do.  

Risk-First is split into three main parts:

 - [Part 1: Thinking Risk-First](../thinking/Start.md)
 - [Part 2: The Risk Landscape](../risks/Start.md)
 - [Part 3: Practices](../practices/Start.md)  _(Under Construction)_
 
However, if you want a brief overview of what this is all about, the articles in this section give you a short taster.  

In particular, if you're after a very high-level summary, please check out the [Quick Summary](Quick-Summary.md) article below.
